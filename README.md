## Task List 

---
- [X] Main Page: *A page with a header and links/buttons that'll redirect the user to the setting, encryption, and 
decryption page.*
- [X] Setting Page: *A page that allows the user to adjust rotation amount.*
- [X] Encryption Page: *A page that allows user to encrypt their desired message, outputting its corresponding 
hash value.*
- [X] Decryption Page: *A page where the user is prompted to input their encrypted message and hash value. 
If the user hash value and computed hash value match, the decrypted message will be output.*
- [X] Error Page: *A page the user is directed to if hash value and computed hash value does not match.*
- [ ] Unit Test: *Ensure all the pages function properly via unit tests.*
